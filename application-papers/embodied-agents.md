## Embodied Agents
* Feature a physical embodiment, like Minecraft characters or household robots, operating within an environment
* Require robustness in unfamiliar settings and the ability to complete long-term tasks
* Emphasize meticulous planning, tool/skill creation, and effective memory utilization
