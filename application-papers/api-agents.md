## API Agents
* Enable users to operate specialized software via simple voice or text instructions
* Treat any software that supports REST APIs or Python SDKs as an agent’s tool
* Handle complex applications, including 3D modeling in manufacturing or chemistry
* Incorporate “Agentic Process Automation,” an evolution of RPA for routine workflows
